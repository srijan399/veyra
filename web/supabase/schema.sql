-- Veyra database schema.
--
-- SUPERSEDED: schema changes now go through Drizzle (web/lib/db/schema.ts +
-- web/drizzle/*.sql, applied with `pnpm db:generate` / `pnpm db:migrate`), not this file
-- run by hand. Kept for historical reference only — the table shapes below match
-- web/drizzle/0000_dapper_ghost_rider.sql and the RLS/trigger/grants below match
-- web/drizzle/0001_rls_policies.sql verbatim, at least as of when this note was added.
-- Do not run this file against a database that has already run the Drizzle migrations,
-- it duplicates them (harmlessly, since it is idempotent, but there is no reason to).
--
-- Original header, still accurate for what the SQL below does:
--
-- Run this once against the project's Postgres database:
--   Supabase Dashboard -> SQL Editor -> paste -> Run
--
-- The whole file is idempotent (`if not exists` / `drop policy if exists`), so it is safe
-- to re-run after editing. It matches TECHNICAL_ARCH.md section 3.3 and the
-- "Authentication" section that follows it.
--
-- MANUAL DASHBOARD STEP REQUIRED (cannot be done from SQL or app code):
--   Authentication -> Providers -> Email -> turn OFF "Confirm email".
--   This is a hackathon build demoed live. With confirmation on, `signUp` returns a user
--   with no session and the signup flow dead-ends waiting on an email that nobody will
--   click on stage. See TECHNICAL_ARCH.md -> Authentication -> Project settings.

-- 1. Profiles
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Supabase Auth already owns identity in `auth.users`. `profiles` is the app-owned
-- extension of that row — never a second users table. `id` IS the auth user id, which is
-- what makes `id = auth.uid()` a valid ownership check.

-- If this file is run against a database where `workflows` / `campaigns` already exist
-- without a `user_id`, the create-table statements above are no-ops and these add the
-- column. Existing rows get a null owner and become invisible under RLS, which is the
-- correct outcome — there is no way to retroactively attribute them.
alter table public.workflows add column if not exists user_id uuid references auth.users (id) on delete cascade;
alter table public.campaigns add column if not exists user_id uuid references auth.users (id) on delete cascade;

-- Every RLS policy below filters on one of these columns, so each index backs a predicate

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. Auto-create a profile for every new auth user
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The signup form passes full_name / company_name through supabase.auth.signUp's
-- `options.data`, which lands in auth.users.raw_user_meta_data. This trigger copies them
-- into profiles so the app never has to do a second round trip after signup.
--
-- SECURITY: raw_user_meta_data is user-editable (a client can update it at any time), so
-- it must never carry authorization data. `role` is therefore NOT read from metadata — it
-- is left to the column default, 'business_user'. If Veyra ever grows real roles, they
-- belong in raw_app_meta_data or an admin-only write path, not here.
--
-- security definer + `set search_path = ''` is the standard Supabase trigger shape: the
-- function must write to public.profiles as the owner, and an empty search_path stops a
-- caller-controlled schema from shadowing the objects it references.

create or replace function public.handle_new_user()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer
set search_path = ''
as $$
begin
  insert into public.profiles (id, full_name, company_name)
  values (
    new.id,
    nullif(trim(new.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'full_name'), ''),
    nullif(trim(new.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'company_name'), '')
  )
  on conflict (id) do nothing;

  return new;
end;
$$;

drop trigger if exists on_auth_user_created on auth.users;

create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row
  execute function public.handle_new_user();

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 4. Row Level Security
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- `public` is exposed through the Data API, so every table in it gets RLS. Tables with no
-- policies (processed_webhook_events) are then reachable only by the database owner used
-- by the server-only call lifecycle writer — exactly what the webhook route needs and
-- what the browser must not have.

alter table public.profiles                 enable row level security;
alter table public.workflows                enable row level security;
alter table public.campaigns                enable row level security;
alter table public.contacts                 enable row level security;
alter table public.call_results             enable row level security;
alter table public.processed_webhook_events enable row level security;

-- Conventions used by every policy below:
--   * `to authenticated` rather than `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` — the latter is
--     deprecated, and it silently passes for anonymous sign-ins.
--   * `(select auth.uid())` rather than bare `auth.uid()`, so Postgres evaluates it once
--     per statement instead of once per row.
--   * `to authenticated` on its own is authentication without authorization; the
--     ownership predicate in `using` is what actually scopes the rows.
--   * UPDATE carries both `using` (which rows may be updated) and `with check` (what they
--     may become). Without `with check` a user could reassign user_id to someone else.
--     Without a matching SELECT policy, UPDATE silently affects 0 rows.

-- --- profiles: the row is its own owner ------------------------------------
-- No delete policy: profiles are removed by the `on delete cascade` from auth.users. A
-- user deleting their own profile while their auth user lives on would leave the app with
-- a signed-in user and no name to show.

-- --- contacts and call_results: ownership inherited from the parent campaign -
-- These carry no user_id of their own. Duplicating the column would mean two places to

-- keeps one source of truth. campaigns_user_id_idx keeps the exists() cheap.

drop policy if exists "contacts_own_campaign" on public.contacts;
create policy "contacts_own_campaign" on public.contacts
  for all to authenticated
  using (
    exists (
      select 1 from public.campaigns c

-- 5. Data API grants
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Depending on the project's Data API settings, tables created from raw SQL are not
-- automatically granted to the API roles. RLS decides which ROWS are visible; these grants
-- decide whether the table is reachable at all. `anon` is granted nothing — every policy
-- above requires an authenticated user anyway.

grant usage on schema public to authenticated;
grant select, insert, update         on public.profiles     to authenticated;
grant select, insert, update, delete on public.workflows    to authenticated;
grant select, insert, update, delete on public.campaigns    to authenticated;
grant select, insert, update, delete on public.contacts     to authenticated;
grant select                         on public.call_results to authenticated;
