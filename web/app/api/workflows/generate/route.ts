 * Auth: requireUser() gates the whole route (that part is unchanged — it still verifies
 * the session via Supabase Auth). The insert itself runs through withRLS(), which
 * impersonates this user for one transaction so the same `workflows_insert_own` RLS
 * policy that used to run under PostgREST still runs here: a request without a valid
 * session never reaches the insert, and one with a valid session cannot write a row it
 * doesn't own — Postgres enforces that, not this route's code.
