"""
Python port of the compilation layer described in TECHNICAL_ARCH.md section 7
(lib/compiler.ts). Flattens a Workflow graph into a single CALL-E Calls API request —
a natural-language `task` plus a `result_schema`. CALL-E runs one adaptive conversation
from that task and extracts structured data at the end of the call; it does not execute
an external branching graph, so the graph never survives past this point as structure.

This module never talks to CALL-E and never sees CALLE_API_KEY — it only produces the
request body. Next.js's lib/calle-client.ts is what actually dispatches it.
